Intro

- inevitable that i should talk about practical necromancy. let me tell you why. 
- in central greece, in the Peloponnesus, there’s a lake high up in the mountains, lake stymphalos. Hercules fought the birds; crusaders built a monastery; partisans fought; and 18 year old me dug
- my trench: bricks; trench next: a vampire.   [1st person dies, others get sick, must be 1st person who kills, go dig ‘em up, ruddy, hide skull etc]
- so i determined to become an archaeologist! And I learned, and eventually became a specialist…. not in vampires, but stamped roman bricks.

Archaeology Has A Problem

- a lot of archaeology doesn’t have the kind of romance that a vampire holds
- but that story fires the imagination, doesn’t it? We can imagine ourselves into that culture, and get a sense of the terror that must’ve held the village tight? it’s easy to move from the traces and remains to some sort of sense of what was going on
- most archaeology doesn’t allow that.
- we have traces; and we have the story we want to tell, but the space between, the gap: we cross it on slender threads of archaeological theory
- today i’m here to talk to you about one way I bridge that gap, and thinking of my vampire, I have often called it a practical necromancy: i raise the dead computationally to ask them to relive a kind of life to see how what I imagine matches to my evidence.

Cross the Gap

- simulation of the kind I practice is still very novel in Roman archaeology. For an archaeology that comes out of the humanities, simulation can sometimes seem a bit heretical, a bit ‘nefas’, or ‘sin’, ‘abomination’ 
- speaking of sin and abomination, I’m going to start with a bit of a potted history of divination and necromancy in a greco-roman context, and why ‘necromancy’ gets a bad rap
- then I’ll shift gears and make an enormous leap to connect digital technologies as a similar technology of divination, and then show how raise the dead digitally lets us explore the entire space of what-could-have-been versus what-evidence-we’ve-got.
- I don’t predict the future; I don’t predict the past; I map the landscape of roads not taken, I guess.

Augury 

- my grandpa used to get the farmer’s almanac; in it, he read the report on the portents to work out what to expect in his fields each year. Did he believe in it? Says he didn’t. But he read it religiously
- to be human is to need to know the future. Romans had a variety of approaches. Augury, portents, birds. passive though: you set up the zone to watch, interpret the flight.
-  a wide variety of ways - omens, reading livers, examining entrails. Being the priest who does the interpretation a political prize worth fighting over. 


Delphi

-  another area of ancient magic/religious practice where ‘interpretation’ was key was in terms of oracular prophecies.
-  Delphi most famous of these; Petitioner asks their question; Pythia high on fumes babbles a response; priests interpret via delivering a riddle
-  Riddles describe a world; they can be solved; they join representation w/ puzzle; they’re almost a kind of game
-  They represent the world, control the world, explore the world

Why Raising the Dead is Usually Frowned Upon

-  again, the things that are appropriate to do, that are ‘fas’, are when the world is revealed to us
-  The things that are ‘nefas’, sin, abomination, are when we go out and wrench that information out for ourselves. 
- Necromancers don’t sit around waiting for revelation. Through their art, they reach out and compel the dead - who have answers, clear sight! - to tell us a thing or two

Necromancers don’t wait for revelation

-  Next to no archaeological evidence for necromancy; only accounts in the literature, which have their own agenda;
- Only advice the dead can give is a function of what they knew in life
- We hear of Odysseus who goes to underworld to consult Tiresias, w/ spells taught him by sorceress Circe
- King Saul consults Witch of Endor to raise spirit of Samuel;
- Periander goes to Oracle of the Dead @ river Acheron to raise ghost of his dead friend ‘tell me where the treasure is!’ - gets his murdered wife instead.
- With necromancy, you’re never sure just what might happen next. It’s dangerous.

With Practical Necromancy, we build simulations 

- actual necromancy is impractical. The dead I want to reach are too far gone; the rites are too messy.
- But so far, archaeology is rather more like the priests who wait and observe and interpret. But that leads to that gap I mentioned before. 
- Necromancers get a bad rap. They’re trying! They’re going to the source! They bridge the gap!
- If the farmer’s almanac is a modern waiting-for-portents, then this weather app on my phone is a modern necromancy. For it tries to predict the future based on extrapolating from patterns in the recent past.
- I realize that maybe this is a bit of a stretch.
- But consider that modern digital computation is thoroughly implicated with technologies of death.
- The digital computer emerges to fill the need to compute ballistics in war, to simulate the energies of nuclear bombs, to determine acceptable levels of casualties, fallout, and destruction.
- At the same time the modern digital computer is being created, some of its earliest proponents worked out that it could be used to predict the weather: if we knew the position of air masses, air pressures, in the past, and we knew the physics, we could work out future states of the problem.
- ‘Simulation’ as a methodology has plenty of parallels, I think, with necromancy.

Golems

- but the problem that early simulationists had to reckon with - that maybe ancient necromancers had to reckon with, when the wrong ghost appear - is that these are not linear systems.
- They are complex, rather than complicated. Space shuttle: complicated. Traffic jam: complex. If you can describe a system such that its parts add up to the whole, it’s complicated. Queensway example. 
- In complex systems, starting conditions matter, and you need to be able to see what emerges, what non-linear feedback loops might produce. 
- Necromancers had it right. Don’t try to describe the system. Describe the individual. 
- And with the computer: describe an entire population of individuals, and then turn them loose. 

Phil Connors, patron saint

- Groundhog Day is an agent based simulation. 
- Every individual understands rules of behaviour and implements the appropriate behaviour given their individual context
- Phil Connors is outside this complex system of Puxatawny; by changing the parameters of the model - his own behaviour - he is able to sweep through the entire landscape of possible worlds - ranging from world 1, where Phil is an asshole, to world 3 million, where he is a saint.
- My simulations then:
- I work out the rules of behaviour for a lower level of complexity than the one I’m actually interested in. If I’m interested in traffic jams, I describe the rules for an individual driver, not the jam
- I create a heterogenous population of these drivers
- I create a world for them to live in
- I turn them loose, allowing them to interact & interpret their rules according to their local situation - I study, like the necromancer, the things that emerge from my rites and rituals
- I re-run the world over and over, changing the starting conditions
- I then map the history I do know, or the traces of individual behaviour that I do have, against the entire landscape of possible outcomes 

Artificial Anasazi; ancient Puebloan peoples

- here, the agents are households, and the question is, how do they respond to climate stress?
- You can see the code is actually near-english; the platform that many of us practical necromancers use, Netlogo, is meant to be used to teach high school students about complex systems and non-linear interactions.

Roman Civil Violence

- diffusion model etc (jma)
- Remember my stamped bricks? 
- Networks of relationships, snapshots over time, but no way of explaining how one snapshot becomes another. How, why, and under what conditions would these networks transform?
- I resurrected some Romans and gave them patterns of social relationships from the archaeology
- Given that exploitation of land in the Roman world is a game of patronage, I gave them rules of behaviour drawn from descriptions of the roman ritual of Salutatio, where patron-client relationships were reaffirmed, put on display in the community, or indeed, destroyed.
- Under what economic conditions would such networks transform? That was my question; civil violence could emerge from the structure of networks under particular conditions I found.
    - In another simulation, I wonder, what economic conditions could generate such network patterns? I took the just-so stories that roman economic historians tell about the past and turned those into code, and turned the resurrected dead loose in those worlds. And very often, I could not generate anything that looked like the actual evidence I had. 

- That gap I mentioned, in archaeology? Another word for it is ‘equifinality’, or the idea that many different processes could result in the same distribution of materials. Sometimes, with practical necromancy, you don’t end up with an answer, but you do narrow down the possibilities - we’re able to say ‘this story is better than that one’, which is still a win!
