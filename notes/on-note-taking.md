- aim today is not to tell you how to take notes, or show you cool tools;
- it is to get you mindful of how the tools or approach _you_ use affects your thinking
- so I'll tell the story of things I've screwed up and things that kinda worked

## 2

- i've always muddled through. then, I wasn't in academia for a long time. what skills I had, had withered, atrophied, for taking meaningful notes. I still read a lot, still wrote a lot, but I did not really have a meaningful note taking habit, if you see what I mean
- my phd approach; book after book of dead notes

## 3
working with Hollis - the everyday ablism of academia - how to take good notes when you can't hold a book open, and typing is not particularly easy? Finding an approach that could work with Hollis sparked a long interest in the basic tools of being a modern digitally-inflected academic. We all use digital tools, but that doesn't mean we have data or digital literacy to any great degree;

## 4
Solution we found for Hollis - nvAlt
- rapid note taking tool; search & note creation in the same pane; notes kept in a database;
- instead of disabling, this tool **enabled** Hollis to have a deeper engagement with his reading & research

## 5
- blogging research process at encouragement of Alan Liu & 1st digital workshop at UND Lincoln in '06
- Electric Archaeology became a kind of research notebook or workbench record
- it's really more of a space for reflecting on things I've done, as well as keeping track of some of the nitty gritty of learning various technologies; sometimes I post essays or works-in-progress. In the last decade I have written 20 posts there on various attempts at finding the ideal notebook workflow for reading and engaging with academic literature. I could've made a U2 joke here, but didn't, you'll be pleased to observe.

## 6
- over the years, things got.... complex. screenshot of an automator workflow to liberate notes from nvAlt into other formats, inspired by Scrivener
- I also, at around the same time, started using Scrivener for my writing. Since scrivener uses the visual metaphor of index cards on a cork board, which you can move around to find the right order for your thoughts, and keeps those individual index cards as unique text files in a folder, I figured I could use something like Notational Velocity to push what I was making there into a scrivener project, and then I could write around the notes, AND I could push things to a private repo on Github or move to dropbox for safekeeping.... waaaay tooo many moving pieces.

## 7
- In this, I was inspired by work like Caleb McDaniel's research wiki for his notes while writing The Sweet Taste of Liberty, and work from the open science side of things. 
- But keeping this thing online & working was exhausting. not sustainable 
- And while I still think there's value in this: this is dangerous, obviously, for people who don't look like me, who don't have the security that I do, who don't have my privilege.
- open notebook - key thing about McDaniel's wiki was that it contains the **primary** data itself of his research
- novel for historians; totally of a piece with what archaeology can do with things like opencontext, t-dar, ads
-   i didn't realize this distinction at first
-   AGAIN: open notebooks not always appropriate or safe; documenting an experiment is one thing, documenting white supremacy and pseudoarchaeology on twitter quite another

## 8
- and for all that, my note-taking didn't improve
- it wasn't consistent
- it was too much a damned chore
- But it was around this time that I encountered the workflow of Dan Sheffler, who at the time was writing his PhD. His posts introduced me to the workflow of the sociologist Niklas Luhmann, and Sheffler's implementation of that workflow using the Sublime text editor and a whole bunch of other supporting tools. But I kept trying to marry this approach with an online notebook - radical openness.

## 9 
- I came around to a few realizations the hard way. 
- One, there's a difference about being open about your process, detailing it where other folks can either benefit or help critique/improve it, and basic notetaking.
- Two, that notetaking is writing
- Three, one note should equl one thought
- Four, your notes are a reflection of your thinking and so you've got to make connections.

(and oh - it should be free. I think Devonnote might be quite cool, but I've never used it because I don't want to be investing energy into something that I can't immediately get my students using)
- ALL THAT TO SAY:
- notes are not a thing you make or use, but rather an environment you think **in**
- if physical environment you work in makes a difference for how you learn, then why not the conceptual environment, right?
- answer to questions: myself, obviously, but also my students & colleagues (eg whole use-your-position-to-make-it-safe-for-others thing)
- achieve: if i make an environment that I am happy to be in, then I will be able to _enjoy the process again_

## 10
- that idea about an environment that you're happy to be in: that's the key. And this is where Ahren's book is brilliant; not so much in what it suggests you ought to do, but rather, for how it helps you think about what it is that you want to do. 
- So I thought about what I wanted, and decided that Ahrens' thoughts on that framework were what **i** wanted too
- It should not only make it easy to find notes quickly, it should also point out relevant notes when you need them - even if you did not search for them.
- It should help you to clarify your thoughts, let you experiment with ideas and spark new ones.
- A good system gets exponentially better the more you feed it.

## 11
- the scene has exploded; there are any number of tools & gurus out there now to help you implement Ahren's vision of Luhman's slipbox zettlekasten system. For every tool, there's another acronymn too. Many of these tools/gurus are ahistorical though; 

## 12
- which is what Chris Aldrich explores in this post; I include it for your interest, (and also take a look at how Aldrich uses Tiddlywiki as a commonplace book)
- he notes that many of the new applications that have suddenly burst onto the scene don't seem to realize the deep routes of what they're proposing; even Vannevar Bush's memex idea ignores it. "They have generally been physical books written by hand that contain notes which are categorized by headings (or in a modern context categories or tags. Often theyâ€™re created with an index to help their creators find and organize their notes."


## 13
- current approach - obsidian - a discovery layer & editor that sits on top of a folder of simple text files. future proof! and can use with different tools/approaches without fear of lock-in

## 14
- vaults for undergards with templates for how I want them to document their process and reflection
- group vault via dropbox for my RAs to encourage overlap and connection between different research projects
- explain how to download and get started
- EXPLORE THE HELP VAULT FIRST to get familiar with the interface

## 15
-screenshot of my getting started vault
- Warning: the development community for Obsidian is very active. There are well over 300 individual plugins to add all sorts of functionality to Obsidian. It is easy to get distracted if you are inclined to tinker. Resist adding new plugins until you get a handle on the workflow.
- logic of the notes:
- reference notes: citation, overview - you could build an annotated bibliography from them. 
- literature notes: observations from the reading, written in my own words. try not to copy phrases out. link to the reference note. 
- permanent notes: - i don't like this word; I think of these as my own thoughts. Questions, observations about my reading go here; link to the appropriate reference note.

## 16
- screenshot from my RA vault, showing a reference note, following a template that I pinched from Andy Roddick at McMaster

## 17
- this note needs breaking into two; one thought for the actual observation of the literature, one for my own thought connecting diffusionism to bone trade

## 18
- one way for how you can use notes to build up to a draft of some sort

## 19
- movie showing this

## 20
- integration with hypothesis using a js script kept as a note, and invoked with the 'templater' plugin

## 21
- in preparation for this talk, I took my stack of notes that are refugees from previous systems and approaches, and started pruning & copying the good stuff into the demo vault I shared with you earlier. 
- screenshot to demonstrate that it's all just a stack of text files

## 22
- here's the graph view, coloured by the kind of note, animated to show you how the vault evolved
- the interesting thing here is that I can click through nodes to the notes themselves, so I can use exploration of the graph to surface emergent ideas and broader topics in my writing
- since note taking *is* writing, I'm never confronted by the terror of the empty word document

## 23
- the journey plugin explicitly uses graph traversal to find paths between your notes;
- these paths can then be turned into the nubbin of a longer piece
- by the way, i'm using tags not as descriptive subject headings, but as notes themselves about broader concepts that seem to surface.

## 24
- a good place to go to see what all is happening in the obsidian space is the Obsidian Roundup
- **RESIST** the urge to add all the plugins.
- develop a good note taking habit first before fiddling with features; otherwise, you'll lose the plot.
- or at least, that's what happened to me.
