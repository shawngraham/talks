Then I met Hollis

<aside class="notes"><p>working with Hollis - the everyday ablism of academia - how to take good notes when you can&#39;t hold a book open, and typing is not particularly easy? Finding an approach that could work with Hollis sparked a long interest in the basic tools of being a modern digitally-inflected academic. We all use digital tools, but that doesn&#39;t mean we have data or digital literacy to any great degree;</p>

My Quest

<!-- .element: class="references" -->

<aside class="notes"><p>I keep a <em>kind</em> of notebook at electricarchaeology.ca ; it&#39;s really more of a space for reflecting on things I&#39;ve done, as well as keeping track of some of the nitty gritty of learning various technologies; sometimes I post essays or works-in-progress. In the last decade I have written 20 posts there on various attempts at finding the ideal notebook workflow for reading and engaging with academic literature.</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>things got.... complex. I also, at around the same time, started using Scrivener for my writing. Since scrivener uses the visual metaphor of index cards on a cork board, which you can move around to find the right order for your thoughts, and keeps those individual index cards as unique text files in a folder, I figured I could use something like Notational Velocity to push what I was making there into a scrivener project, and then I could write around the notes, AND I could push things to a private repo on Github or move to dropbox for safekeeping.... waaaay tooo many moving pieces.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
For a while, I was right into trying to make _open_ notebooks

<aside class="notes"><p>In this, I was inspired by work like Caleb McDaniel&#39;s research wiki for his notes while writing The Sweet Taste of Liberty, and work from the open science side of things. But keeping this thing online &amp; working was exhausting. And while I still think there&#39;s value in this: this is dangerous, obviously, for people who don&#39;t look like me, who don&#39;t have the security that I do, who don&#39;t have my privilege.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
And My Note Taking Didn't Improve

<aside class="notes"><p>But it was around this time that I encountered the workflow of Dan Sheffler, who at the time was writing his PhD. His posts introduced me to the workflow of the sociologist Niklas Luhmann, and Sheffler&#39;s implementation of that workflow using the Sublime text editor and a whole bunch of other supporting tools. But I kept trying to marry this approach with an online notebook - radical openness.</p>

Who Am I Doing This For?

And What Do I Want It To Achieve?

<aside class="notes"><p>I came around to a few realizations the hard way. One, there&#39;s a difference about being open about your process, detailing it where other folks can either benefit or help critique/improve it, and basic notetaking.</p>
<p>Two, that notetaking is writing</p>
<p>Three, one note = one thought</p>
<p>Four, your notes are a reflection of your thinking and so you&#39;ve got to make connections.</p>
<p>and oh - it should be free. I think Devonnote might be quite cool, but I&#39;ve never used it because I don&#39;t want to be investing energy into something that I can&#39;t immediately get my students using.</p>

Sonke Ahrens calls this building a framework to think with.

https://takesmartnotes.com

<aside class="notes"><p>It should not only make it easy to find notes quickly, it should also point out relevant notes when you need them - even if you did not search for them.</p>
<p>It should help you to clarify your thoughts, let you experiment with ideas and spark new ones.</p>
<p>A good system gets exponentially better the more you feed it.</p>

The core idea: one thought, one note; find the connections between them, and knowledge/inspiration will emerge

<aside class="notes"><p>With the publication of Sonke Ahren&#39;s book on How To Take Smart Notes, the note taking scene exploded.</p>

### The Personal Knowledge Management Scene

[Chris Aldrich & the deep origins of note taking tools in the humble commonplace book](https://boffosocko.com/2021/07/03/differentiating-online-variations-of-the-commonplace-book-digital-gardens-wikis-zettlekasten-waste-books-florilegia-and-second-brains/)

<aside class="notes"><p>he notes that many of the new applications that have suddenly burst onto the scene don&#39;t seem to realize the deep routes of what they&#39;re proposing; even Vannevar Bush&#39;s memex idea ignores it. &quot;They have generally been physical books written by hand that contain notes which are categorized by headings (or in a modern context categories or tags. Often they’re created with an index to help their creators find and organize their notes.&quot;</p>

This is a note in progress. Link goes back to the original reference. It still needs to be linked to the Jeb Card reference. I could tag it; tags are just another kind of link.

## Using Obsidian to draft new work

- use the graph to identify clusters of connected thoughts
- think about what those clusters mean
- make a new note _into which_ you make links or embed passages from these other notes
- write the connective text
- export to word for typography and layout
